# Printing a simple statement
print "I will count my stamps"

# Printing 25 + 30 / 6
print "Stamp 1", 25 + 30 / 6
# Printing 100 - 25 * 3 % 4
print "Stamp 2", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

print "Now I will count the eggs:"

# Printing 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6
print 3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6

print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7 ?"

# A conditional operator
print 3 + 2 < 5 - 7

# Breaking the statement into two separate parts
print "What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2

print "What is 5 - 7?", 5-7

print "Oh that's why it's False."

print "How about some more."
# Greater than
print "Is it greater?", 5 > -2
# Greater than or equal
print "Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2
# Less than or equal
print "Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2
